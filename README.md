# US Open 2025 Calendar Generator

This project generates an iCalendar (`.ics`) file for the US Open 2025 tennis tournament, using official schedule data from the US Open website.

## Features

- Fetches live match schedules from the US Open API.
- Parses match details, including player names, court, round, and start time.
- Outputs a standards-compliant `.ics` calendar file for easy import into Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar, etc.
